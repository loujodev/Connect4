Connect4 AI Agents Project

This Connect4 implementation allows users to play against different AI agents or watch AI agents compete against each other. 
The primary focus is on developing and comparing various AI techniques, including a classic Minimax algorithm and a Machine Learning-based agent. 
The project also provides a suite of evaluation tools to analyze agent performance based on metrics like win rate, game length, resource utilization, and search efficiency for Minimax.
